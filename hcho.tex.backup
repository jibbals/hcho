\section{Methods}
  \subsection{GEOS-Chem simulation}
    The GEOS-Chem global atmospheric chemistry model (V10.01) simulates and records up to 66 chemical species (tracers) in the standard run, at 2 by 2.5$^{\circ}$ horizontal resolution, with 47 levels up to the top of the atmosphere (TOA at 0.01~hPa). 
    Output for an area averaged over 1200 - 1400 local time can be saved for comparison and recalculation with satellite overpass records.
    GEOS-5 meteorological fields from NASA's ...(TODO: ref and note) are used to drive transport and coupled with the chemical module of GEOS-Chem.
  \subsection{Recalculation of OMI HCHO}
  
  \subsection{Calculation of Emissions}
    % \label{ch_isop:sec:EmissionCalculation} <- thesis label
    \label{sec:EmissionCalculation}
    
    As is done in \citet{Palmer2003, Millet2006, Bauwens2016}, we assume that HCHO, and Isoprene columns are in a steady state, with no horizontal transport.
    In these circumstances the emissions of precursors are easy to calculate as long as we know the molar HCHO yields (Y$_i$) and effective chemical loss rates (k$_i$):
    \begin{equation}
      \Omega_{HCHO} = \frac{1}{k_{HCHO}}\Sigma_i k_i Y_i \Omega_i = \frac{1}{k_{HCHO}}\Sigma_i Y_i E_i
    \end{equation}
    
    We can infer the local (grid space) isoprene emissions (E$_{isop}$) using effective formaldehyde yield from isoprene ($Y_{isop}$).
    \begin{equation} \label{eqn:isop_yield}
      \Omega_{HCHO} = S \times E_{isop} + B
    \end{equation}
    Where \textit{B} is the background HCHO, and $S = Y_{isop}/k_{HCHO}$ is determined monthly as the regression between $\Omega_{HCHO}$ and E$_{isop}$ on daily saved outputs from GEOS-Chem over Australia using 2 by 2.5$^{\circ}$ horizontal resolution.
    
    % Other method: $k_{HCHO}*\Omega_{HCHO}$, and $k_{isop}*\Omega_{isop}$.
    %For an initial estimate of the effective yield from simulated data: we use $k_{HCHO}$, $k_{i}$, $\Omega_{HCHO}$, and $\Omega_i$ outputs from a standard run of GEOS-Chem - which provides one data point per day.
    This gives us a monthly value for $Y_i$ resolved to our 2$^{\circ}$ by 2.5$^{\circ}$ horizontal resolution, which is entirely based on the model.
    Using our measurements of the biogenic HCHO column ($\Omega_{OMIHCHO}$) recalculated from the OMI satellite product, we use this derived yield and the same formula to determine our new top-down emissions estimates.
    Figure \ref{fig:E_isop_vs_hcho_model_sample} shows the modelled isoprene emissions and column HCHO concentrations along with the RMA regression line, sampled from grid boxes over Australia for January 2005.
    Some affects from the low emissions in grid boxes which are largely oceanic can be seen and are handled by TODO: handle these and document here.
    
    Modeled background emissions are ignored as they do not affect the calculation of the modeled slope.
    However, when calculating the $E_{isop}$ from our modeled slope 
    \begin{figure}[!htbp]
      % Figure from GC_tests.py -> isop_hcho_RMA
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/E_isop_vs_hcho_series.png}
      \caption{%
	Top panel: isoprene emissions for January, 2005, shown in red, coplotted with tropospheric hcho columns, shown in magenta.
	Both series are daily averages over Australia.
	Bottom panel: (RMA) linear regressions from between emissions of isoprene and tropospheric hcho columns, sampled randomly from the 2$^{\circ}$ by 2.5$^{\circ}$ latitude longitude gridboxes over Australia for the month of January (2005).
      }
      \label{fig:E_isop_vs_hcho_model_sample}
    \end{figure}
    
    Using this modelled slope at 2$^{\circ}$ by 2.5$^{\circ}$ and applying it to equation \ref{eqn:isop_yield} with B and $\Omega_{HCHO}$ calculated using OMI satellite measurements provides a new estimate of isoprene emissions.
    Figure TODO: \ref{fig:E_isop_200501} shows the emissions calculated this way along with the Emissions output by GEOS-Chem averaged over January, 2005.
